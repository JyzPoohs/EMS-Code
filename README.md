### Techonology 
The foundation of our project is built on Laravel, a popular and versatile PHP framework that enables rapid development and ensures code maintainability. To enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness, we have incorporated Bootstrap, a front-end framework that enables us to create dynamic and mobile-friendly interfaces. For local development, we recommend using Laragon or XAMPP, which provide a complete environment to run and manage our application effectively. The back-end is powered by PHP, a widely used scripting language known for its versatility and performance. To store and retrieve data, we have utilized mySQL, a reliable and efficient relational database management system.
